#everthing that I have learned about in programming class from day one to date,
#we started by defining terminologies we used to use in the software engineering class such as HTML, CSS, markup etc.
#and with this I learned that HTML in full is Hypertext Markup Language and CSS is Cascading Style Sheet.
# we further went on to try and understand what those terms mean and I learned that HTML uses text to represent other text, and markup is used for designing while CSS is used as a style sheet to give add beauty and uniformity or styling.
#I also learned that programming is the art and science of writing computer instructions where attention is given to the computer memory
#we also tried to compare the human brain to the memory of the computer where we discovered that human brain can be corrupted by age, diseases like amnesia etc and the computer memory is corrupted by viruses and bugs.  
#I also learned that the human brain is unlimited while computer memory is limited
#I also learned that  the CPU is the brain of the computer
#I learned that there are 3 types of computer memory and they include;
#optical memory. In this memory, data is written on or read using light e.g DVD/CD
#metallic drive/HDD. In this memory, data is written on or read using electricity or electromagnetic fields
#Copying and writing. Here data is directly copied from elsewhere e.g flash drive

#I also learned that memory is categorised in terms of relevance and this is through primary memory which is the main memory and secondary memory which is the RAM
#Memory is further categorised in terms of location and this is internal on HDD and RAM or external memory on a flash drive, CD, DVD
#Memory is read through 3 methods which are through light, electromagnetic fields and copying
#the main components of the memory are the CPU and hard drive

#I also learned that the RAM temporarily stores data until it goes to the HDD. 
#I also learned that there are special memories the computer can access such as cache, buffer, register and RAM
#Cache stores frequently accessed files, RAM accesses files in the HD through keeping references that memory will use then buffer is used to store information temporarily for a new file as it is being input
#I learned that the CPU does not directly communicate with the hard drive but rather does so through the RAM and its smaller memory spaces

#I learned about the hard disk and its components where i learned data is loaded from the inner most part of the platter moving out. I also learned that a brand new laptop whose memory isn't partitioned is called NOOB(new out of the box). Partitioning is the act of creating smaller parts from the whole thing. Partitions are created so that files are manageably stored and all portions are usually equal after partitioning is done. A full partition is called a track while a part of it is known as a sector. 
#I also learned that partitioning is only done by operating systems such as Windows, Linux and IOS
#I learned that identifiers are given to the partitions and its these identifier names attached to a memory run in the RAM to access a file

#I learned that python was created by Guido Van Rossum who is a belgian national currently living in the United States. 
#I also learned that python is a 4th generation language making it the  closest to human language. 
#I learned that the creation of python was inspired by a comedy show called Monte python guys which Guido was watching over a christmas eve. 
#I learned that python was an improved version of ABC. Python is managed by a company called Python Software Foundation where Guido Van Rossum is still the president. 
#I also learned that python is used to manipulate the memory
#I learned that python is easy to learn, object-oriented, multi-purpose and a 4th generation language
#I learned that there two principles which are compilation for C and java languages and interpretation which is for HTML, Javascript and Python
#I also learned that rules that govern the use of a programming language are called syntax while rules that govern the human language are called grammar
#I further learned that syntax is written while grammar is written and spoken
#I also learned that there rules in writing python for instance a # represents a comment, variable names should start with a special character(@,$,#), variables should not have spaces between them, variable names should not be repeated in different forms because python is case sensitive, we should always use relatable names,names should not start with a capital letter unless they are functions or classes and lastly variables names should not start with a numerical order
#I also learned that the process of naming a computer memory address is called declaring
#I also learned that giving a variable a value is known as initializing
#I learned that >>> are known as chevrolets
#I also learned that a full instruction to a computer is called a statement, 2 or more statements turn into a code then 1 or more groups of code are known as a program
#I also learned that a variable is a named memory space

#I learned that data types are different categories of content that are going to be stored in the memory. 
#I learned that data types efficiently utilise our memory so that we are not wasteful
#I also learned that there different types of data types namely numeric, string, boolean, sequence, boolean and mapping
#I learned that under numeric we have integers, float and complex number. I also learned that a string is a group of characters
#I learned that anything other put in quotes is output as is and as a must brackets are used to print
#I learned that under sequence data type we have 3 categories namely list, tuples and range
#I learned that a list is a variable that can store more than one value
#I also learned that a list is a mutable data type because it can be manipulated after its creation while a tuple is an immutable data type meaning those values cant be changed. I also learned that tuples can be typecasted meaning you can change a tuple  into a list but the reverse isnt possible
#I learned that print is a specialised command used to output values on a computer screen
# I learned that append is a specialised command used to give values to a list
#I learned that pop is used to remove a last value of a list
# I learned that tuples are identified by () which are called parenthesis
# I learned that lists are identified by []  
#I learned that under mapping we have the dictionary data type and that it is identified by {}
# I learned that a  set is unordered selection of unique values
#I learned that the best way to problem solving is to have a framework and practice alot
# I learned that when solving a problem there steps we can follow such as understanding the problem, planning, dividing it into sub-problems, debugging, reassessing and researching then constant practicing. Practice exposes you to more complex problems and you reach a point where you solve problems easily
# Today i learned that an operator is a special character that tells a computer what to do with a value
#I learned that there are arithmetic operators such as addition(+), multiplication(*),subtraction(-), division(/),floordivision(//), exponential(**),modulo(%)
# I learned that there are also assignment operators such as equal sign(=), addition assignment operator(+=), subtraction assignment operator(-=), division assignment operator(/=), exponential assignment operator(**=), modulo assignment operator(%=), multiplication assignment operator(*=)
